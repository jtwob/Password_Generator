# Password Generator

## Description:

Upon new password generation request, this application prompts the user for character types to be included, along with the desired length of the password. It accomplishes this by creating an array of all the user requested char types, and randomly selecting the char type for the next character in the password. The preferences are temporarily stored in an object for reference in other functions. The application then selects a character at random from the previously chosen char type to be added to the password using a switch statement.

Once the generated password reaches the desired length, the application returns the password to the window on the web-page, to be copied and used at the user's lesiure.
